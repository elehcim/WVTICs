# WVT ICs

### *Description* 
- Generate glass-like initial conditions for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
- Relaxation of the particle distribution is done using al algorithm based on Weighted Voronoi Tesselations (Diehl et al. 2012)
- Additional particle reshuffling can be enabled to improve over- and undersampled maxima/minima
- A full suite of (analytical) testproblems is included

### *Installation*
Tailor the Makefile (or CMakeLists.txt) to your machine, and run
`make` or `cmake`

### *Usage*
Adjust the parameterfile `ics.par` and run the code. See the `examples` folder for example parameterfiles.
`OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./WVTICs ics.par`
